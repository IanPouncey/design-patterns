<h1>Button examples</h1>

<p>The buttons on this page have been created using <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> elements, with scripting to provide the expected behaviour. At first glance both buttons appear to be the same, but there are fundamental differences between the two design patterns.</p>

<h2>Button 1</h2>

<div id="example">
<span id="button1" class="default" onclick="javascript:toggleButton1(event);">Button 1</span>
</div>

<h3>Button 1 code</h3>

<div>
<pre><code>
&lt;span id="button1" class="default" onclick="javascript:toggleButton1(event);"&gt;Button 1&lt;/span&gt;
</code></pre>
</div>

<h3>Button 1 notes</h3>

<p>The <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> element is semantically neutral. It has no implicit role that informs assistive technologies what the control's purpose is. In other words, there is nothing to indicate to assistive technologies that Button 1 is a button. It is simply treated as plain text.</p>

<p>The <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> element is not a natively <a href="http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/interactive-elements.html">interactive element</a>, so Button 1 can't be focused on with a keyboard or targeted with speech recognition tools.</p>

<p>Button 1 can be focused on with a screen reader (using its <a href="http://tink.co.uk/2014/09/understanding-screen-reader-interaction-modes/">virtual cursor</a> (or equivalent)), but it cannot be activated with the keyboard. The enter key does nothing, and the space key fires its default action - scrolling the page.</p>

<p>The change in state of Button 1 is purely cosmetic. There is no programmatic indication, meaning that screen reader users remain oblivious to the button's current state.</p>

<h2>Button 2</h2>

<div id="example">
<span id="button2" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-pressed="false" onclick="javascript:toggleButton2(event);" onkeyup="handleBtnKeyUp(event);">Button 2</span>
</div>

<h3>Button 2 code</h3>

<div>
<pre><code>
&lt;span id="button2" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-pressed="false" onclick="javascript:toggleButton2(event);" onkeyup="handleBtnKeyUp(event);"&gt;Button 2&lt;/span&gt;
</code></pre>
</div>

<h3>Button 2 notes</h3>

<p>Uses the ARIA <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/roles">role attribute</a> with a value of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/roles#button">button</a>. This informs the browser that it should expose the Button 2 as a button through its accessibility API. This information is utilised by assistive technologies to inform users what they're dealing with.</p>

<p>Uses the HTML <a href="http://www.paciellogroup.com/blog/2014/08/using-the-tabindex-attribute/">tabindex attribute</a> with a value of 0. This places Button 2 into the tab order based on its location in the source order. The visual appearance of Button 2 now changes when focus moves to it.</p>

<p>Keyboard interaction for Button 2 is handled through scripting. Both enter and space key events are captured, and used to trigger the button's expected behaviour.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/states_and_properties#aria-pressed">aria-pressed</a> attribute is used to indicate the state of Button 2. It is set to false initially, then scripted to toggle between true/false whenever the button is activated.</p>

<p>The visual appearance of Button 2 when pressed (or not) is hooked onto the aria-pressed attribute using an <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/08/20/semantic-css-with-intelligent-selectors/">intelligent CSS selector</a>, instead of a class name. Although this does not affect accessibility, it creates a cleaner separation between structure and design.</p>

<p>Based on the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#button">button design pattern</a> from the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/">ARIA Authoring Practices Guide</a>.</p>
